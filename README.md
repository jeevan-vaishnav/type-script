# About this handbook

Over 20 years after its introduction to the programming community, JS is now core of the most widespread cross platform
languages ever created.
Starting as a small scripting language for adding trivial interactivity to webpages, JS has grown to be a language of choice for both forntend and backend applications of every size. While the sizem scope, and complexity of programs written in JS has grown exponentially, the ability of the js language to express the relationship between different units of code has not combined with JS rather peculiar runtime semantics, this mismatch betwen language and program complexity has made js development a difficult task to manage at scale. 

The most common kinds of errors that programmers write can be describe as type errors: a certian kind of value was used where a different kind of value was expected. This could be due to simple typos, a failure to understand the API surface of a library, incorrect assumptions about runtime behavior, or other errors. The goal of TS is to be static typercheck for JS programs - in other words , a tool that runs before your code runs static and ensures that tha types of the program are correct typechecked.
